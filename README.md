# DeepNeuralNetwork-Projects
The difference between dnn and machine learning is that in machine learning, we extract a series of features and give them to our model to do the classification, but in the case of deep neural networks, there is no need for pre-processing and here The model itself takes the input, extracts and classifies the features, and finally delivers the output to us.
